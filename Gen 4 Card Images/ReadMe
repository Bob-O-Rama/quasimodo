( non-proprietary ) AutoBel Card and Encode Backup image files.

The Alma Mater... AutoBel Card contains two collections, one song each.

The Lucent... Encode Backup Card contains a few cistom collections, one of which has a very pleasing intro to New Order's Elegia which works very well on bells.

Between the two you have an example of both card types.  Encode Backup cards are AutoBel Cards but with a short header, otherwise the format appears to be identical.   This is reflected in quasimodo.cpp

quasimodo --debug --list filename.dd will hexdump each song's data so you can inspect it.
